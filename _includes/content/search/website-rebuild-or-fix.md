The rebuild vs fix question comes up a lot, and it's usually confusing. Should you fix what's broken, or start over? Here's a clear framework to help you decide—based on what actually makes sense for your situation, not what's most profitable for a developer.

---

#### Quick Answer

**If you have:**
- **A specific problem that can be fixed** → Fix it
- **Multiple problems that can all be fixed** → Fix them
- **Performance issues** → Usually fixable
- **Outdated design** → Redesign, not rebuild

**If you have:**
- **Foundation so broken it can't be fixed** → Rebuild
- **Architecture that fundamentally can't support your needs** → Rebuild
- **Security issues that can't be patched** → Rebuild

#### Clear Framework for Deciding: Rebuild vs Fix

Here's how to think through this decision:

**Fix it when:**
- The problems are specific and fixable
- The foundation is solid enough to build on
- Fixes will solve all your problems
- Fixing costs less than rebuilding
- Fixing takes less time than rebuilding

**Rebuild when:**
- The foundation itself is fundamentally broken
- Fixing everything would cost more than rebuilding
- The architecture can't support what you need
- Security issues can't be patched or updated
- Starting fresh is actually faster than fixing

#### Straight Talk

Here's what you need to know:

**Common problems that can be fixed (don't need rebuild):**
- Slow performance — usually fixable with optimization
- Broken features — can be fixed or rebuilt individually
- Outdated design — redesign, not rebuild
- Content issues — update content, don't rebuild
- Security vulnerabilities — usually patchable
- SEO problems — fixable with technical SEO work

**Problems that require a rebuild:**
- Codebase built on completely unsupported technology
- Architecture that fundamentally can't scale
- Security issues that can't be patched because the foundation is too old
- Technical debt so bad that fixing it would take longer than rebuilding

**What's actually worth paying for:**
- Rebuilding when the foundation truly can't be fixed
- Rebuilding when fixes would cost more than starting fresh
- Rebuilding when you need architecture your current site can't support

**What's usually NOT worth paying for:**
- Rebuilding when fixes would solve everything for less money
- Rebuilding just because technology is "old" (if it works, it works)
- Rebuilding when the problems are design or content-related

**When DIY might work:**
- If you have one simple problem and time to learn, you might be able to fix it yourself
- If the issues are content-related, you can update them yourself
- If it's just a design refresh, you might be able to use a template or DIY tool

#### What I Would Do First

If you're trying to decide between fix and rebuild:

1. **List every problem** — Be specific about what's broken or not working
2. **Get fix estimates** — Find out what it would cost to fix everything
3. **Get rebuild estimates** — Find out what it would cost to start over
4. **Compare timeframes** — How long would fixes take vs rebuild?
5. **Ask "why rebuild?"** — If someone suggests rebuild, ask them to explain why fixes won't work
6. **Consider the foundation** — Is your current foundation solid enough to build on?

#### Cost and Time Comparison

**Fixing usually:**
- Costs a fraction of rebuilding
- Takes less time to complete
- Causes less disruption
- Can be done incrementally

**Rebuilding usually:**
- Costs significantly more
- Takes 2-3x longer
- Causes complete disruption
- Requires starting from scratch

**When fixing makes sense:**
- When it solves all your problems for less money
- When it can be done faster than rebuilding
- When your foundation is solid enough

**When rebuilding makes sense:**
- When fixes would cost more than rebuilding
- When the foundation is too broken to fix
- When you need architecture your current site can't support

---

#### Red Flags vs Green Flags

**Red flags that indicate rebuild is necessary:**
- Foundation built on completely unsupported technology
- Security vulnerabilities that can't be patched
- Architecture that fundamentally can't support your needs
- Fixing everything would cost more than rebuilding

**Green flags that indicate fixes are sufficient:**
- Core functionality works, just needs improvements
- Problems are specific and fixable
- Foundation is solid enough to build on
- Fixes will solve all your problems for less money

#### FAQ

**What's the difference between fixing and rebuilding?**
Fixing means repairing or improving what you have. Rebuilding means starting over with new code and architecture.

**How do I know if my site can be fixed?**
Ask yourself: are the problems fixable with updates, patches, and improvements? If yes, it can probably be fixed. If the foundation itself is broken, you might need a rebuild.

**What if fixing costs almost as much as rebuilding?**
Then rebuilding might make sense—especially if it gives you a better foundation for the future. But get clear estimates for both options first.

**Can I fix some things and rebuild others?**
Sometimes. If only part of your site needs rebuilding, you might be able to rebuild just that section while fixing the rest.

**How long does fixing take vs rebuilding?**
Fixing usually takes less time because you're working with what exists. Rebuilding takes longer because you're starting from scratch.

**What if I'm not sure which I need?**
Get estimates for both options. Talk to someone who will give you honest advice about which makes more sense for your situation.
