Hi, I'm <a href="/" class="bold">Aubrey</a>, a freelance and contract web developer.

To help you feel confident in our partnership, I have broken down common technical concepts into plain English and outlined the specific subjects that build trust.

---

### 1. Moving Beyond the "Order-Taker"
A major red flag when hiring is a freelancer who simply says "yes" to everything without asking questions. A true professional doesn't just take orders; they **think strategically** and tell you what you actually *need* based on your business goals, even if it's different from what you originally asked for.

**How I handle this:** I prioritize **honest guidance and straight talk**. My goal is to be your "web development guy"—the expert friend who is on your side and helps you cut through the hype to find solutions that actually make sense for your mission.

### 2. Translating the Jargon

Trust is often broken when a freelancer hides behind "geek speak." Here is what those technical terms actually mean for your business:

*   **SEO Optimization:** This is simply making sure your website is easy for search engines like Google to find and show to the right people. It's about creating "behind-the-scenes signals" so you don't accidentally hide your best content.
*   **Performance Optimization:** This means keeping your site **fast and smooth** for the people using it. It involves using efficient code and smart loading strategies so the site doesn't feel heavy or break as your business grows.
*   **Core Web Vitals:** These are specific "health markers" Google uses to see if your site provides a good experience (like how fast it loads or how stable it looks).
*   **Legacy Code & Technical Debt:** This refers to older systems or code that have become messy over time. My job is to modernize these systems, ensuring they stay stable while adding new, "modern" features.

### 3. Proof Through "High-Stakes" Experience
Trust is earned through a proven track record. It is one thing to say I can build a site; it is another to have maintained **enterprise-level systems** for global brands.

**How I handle this:** For over a decade, I honed my craft building high-stakes solutions for **Microsoft, Monster.com, and Starbucks**. Whether it was managing "The Mule" (a complex content-sync system for Microsoft) or improving search rankings for Monster.com, I have handled the technical heavy lifting for the world's biggest companies.

### 4. Relationships > Talent
The sources emphasize that **relationships are more powerful than talent, experience, or even budget**. A strong relationship means you have a "inside track" with someone who won't overcharge you and who understands your unique needs.

**How I handle this:** I believe in the power of **"business friends"**. I prefer to work deeply with a few partners rather than chasing a high volume of shallow projects. This allows me to provide **results, not just checklists**, and ensures that I'm there to support you for the long term.

### 5. Clear Processes and Reliability
A lack of structure or "surprise bills" can quickly destroy trust. Trustworthy freelancers provide **transparent pricing, realistic timelines, and a structured process**.

**How I handle this:** I stick to the fundamentals: **simple performs best, and it should just work**. I offer clear explanations and simple processes so you never have to guess what is happening with your project. My aim is to deliver work that is **steady, reliable, and consistent**.

If you're looking for a partner who values **reliability, communication, and results**, let's talk. I've spent years helping big agencies; now, I'm ready to be the expert friend who finally says **"yes"** to your project.
