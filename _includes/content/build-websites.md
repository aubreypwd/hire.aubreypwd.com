### 1. Onboarding

You’ll receive an in-depth questionnaire. Your answers give me everything I need to understand your goals, your business, and the look and feel you want.

We’ll also discuss deliverables (things I need from you), which all have to be delivered by the kick-off date—which we will choose together.

🏢 At this point you will make your first of three payments.

### 2. Setup

You’ll get a single Google Doc that serves as your “home base,” like this one.

It will include:

- A simple checklist of what I need from you before the kickoff call (Deliverables)
- Notes, decisions, and anything important for your project
- A place for you to share assets/etc with me (Google Drive)
- **Bookmark it!**

Everything stays in one place for you. No extra tools to learn, it’s easy.

### 3. Research & Exploration

Once I have your questionnaire and initial payment, I dig in:

- Review your answers (questionnaire)
- Look at your competitors/peers
- Identify design patterns used by successful businesses in your space

I’ll add my findings to the Google Doc so you can see the direction things are heading.

##### 3a. Mood Board

I’ll create a mood board (usually with Pinterest) with visuals that set the tone for your site—colors, typography, imagery, design inspiration.

You can review it any time and tell me what does or doesn’t fit your vision.

##### 3b. Stylescape

I’ll create a simple stylescape: a single image showing the visual direction (colors, fonts, photography, layout feel).

You’ll review it and confirm we’re aligned before we move forward.

##### 3c. Site Map

I’ll create a clear site map showing the structure of the site and the pages we’re building. You’ll approve this before design begins.

##### 4c. Timeline

Based on the work that needs to be done I will develop a timeline on our kickoff call.

### 4. Kickoff Call

Once all deliverables are in and the stylescape/site map are approved, we’ll schedule a kickoff call.

We’ll confirm direction, make sure everything is aligned, the timeline is good, and then we begin the actual build.

During this step we will create a timeline:

- When Design & Development begins and ends
- When Testing and Pre-launch will begin and end
- When Launch will happen

🏢 At this point you will make your second of three payments.

### 5. Design & Development

I’ll usually design the homepage **first**.

When it’s ready, I’ll share it with you over a screen share.

You’ll see:

- The visual direction
- The decisions behind the design
- Key performance considerations

You get one free round of feedback on the homepage and sitemap at this stage.

##### 5b. Finalize, Build, & Review

After updating the homepage based on your feedback (and sitemap), I’ll design the rest of the core pages.

**This is the longest part of the process.**

I’ll screen share the updated homepage and the new subpages for review.

You’ll get one final round of feedback on both before we proceed to build the remaining parts of the site.

### 6. Testing & Launch

During this phase we’ll get the site up on a server and start connecting your website with all-the-things to make sure it works, e.g. payment gateways, etc.

I will also begin writing your website documentation (which lives *inside* your website for easy access).

Together, we test everything: layout, content, links, forms, and performance. *At this point we won’t be changing anything drastically, just making sure it works correctly.*

After the site is fully polished, we’ll choose a launch date and go live on that date (it’s usually just a button I push and it’s live).

🏢 At this point you will make your third and final payment.

### 7. Post-Launch Support

For a week after launch, I’m available for questions and support as you settle into the new site.

### 8. Offboarding Call & What’s Next

After the support week, we’ll have an offboarding call to review how everything went.

We’ll talk about the results, answer any final questions, and discuss any next steps if you want to continue working together.

### 9. Maintenance

If we agreed to do so, our maintenance agreement will begin to kick in. Your site will be designed to auto-update all-the-things moving forward, but if anything goes wrong or issues creep up we can address them quickly.

🏢 Note, this is going to be a monthly subscription fee.
