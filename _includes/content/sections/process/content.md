#### Initial Meeting

During this quick introductory **30-minute** call, we’ll briefly discuss your project and—if you’d like—I can send a quick ballpark quote based on what you share.

&rarr; _This is usually for people who are comparing prices. If you already know you want to move forward, we can jump straight into a deeper call._

If you’d like to continue working with me, we’ll schedule a longer, in-depth call to fully understand your project.

##### In-depth Project Discussion

Before this call, I’ll send over a **questionnaire** with important questions to help me prepare. It keeps our call focused and prevents it from turning into a marathon.

It’s **lengthy**, but you can save a copy for your own use however you’d like.

##### Send Proposal

After our in-depth discussion, I’ll **send over a proposal**.

The proposal includes: a more accurate price, my understanding of what’s best for the project, any packages (see below) you may fit into—or a custom option (which is usually the case)—and all the details.

You can review it at your convenience, text me questions, and we’ll make sure we’re aligned.

&rarr; _Usually the proposal gets tweaked a bit during this stage._

----

#### 1. Onboarding

Once you accept the proposal, we’ll meet on Zoom or Google Meet to confirm details, make any final tweaks if needed, and plan next steps.

We’ll also confirm deliverables—things I need from you—and set due dates. Most of these need to be delivered **by the kickoff call** we schedule together.

_&rarr;&nbsp; At this point you will make your **first** of three payments (your deposit)._

----

#### 2. Setup

You’ll get a single Google Doc that serves as your “home base.”

It will include:

- A simple checklist of what I need from you before the kickoff call (deliverables)
- Notes, decisions, and anything important for your project
- A place for you to share assets with me via Google Drive

&rarr; **Bookmark it!**

Everything stays in one place. No extra tools to learn—simple and easy.

----

#### 3. Research & Exploration

Once I receive your initial payment, I start to dig in:

- Review your questionnaire answers
- Look at your competitors/peers and identify patterns in your market

I’ll add my findings to the Google Doc so you can see the direction things are heading.

##### Mood Board

I’ll create a mood board (often using Pinterest) with visuals that set the tone for your site—colors, typography, imagery, and design inspiration.

&rarr; _If we’re using a template-based design or doing a rebuild of your current site, we may skip this step._

You can review it any time and tell me what does or doesn’t fit your vision.

##### Stylescape

I’ll create a simple stylescape: a single image showing the visual direction (colors, fonts, photography, and overall layout feel).

&rarr; _Again, if we’re using a template-based design or doing a rebuild of your current site, we may skip this step._

You’ll review it and confirm we’re aligned before we move forward.

##### Site Map

I’ll create a clear sitemap showing the structure of the site (_yes, even for one-pagers_) and the pages we’re building. You’ll approve this before design begins.

##### Timeline

Based on the scope, we’ll confirm the timeline during the kickoff call.

----

#### 4. Kickoff Call

Once all deliverables are in and the stylescape/sitemap are approved, we’ll schedule a kickoff call.

We’ll confirm direction, make sure everything is aligned, confirm the timeline, and then begin the actual build.

During this step we’ll finalize a timeline for:

- When Design & Development begins and ends
- When Testing and Pre-launch begins and ends
- When Launch will happen

_&rarr;&nbsp; At this point you will make your **second** of three payments._

----

#### 5. Design & Development

I typically design the homepage **first**.

When it’s ready, I’ll share it with you over a screen share.

You’ll see:

- The visual direction
- The reasoning behind key design decisions
- Key performance considerations

You get one round of feedback on the homepage at this stage.

##### 5b. Finalize, Build, & Review

After updating the homepage based on your feedback (and confirming the sitemap), I’ll design the rest of the core pages.

**This is the longest part of the process.**

I’ll screen share the updated homepage and the new subpages for review.

You’ll get one final round of feedback on the remaining core pages before we proceed to the final build and polish.

----

#### 6. Testing & Launch

During this phase we’ll get the site up on a staging server and start connecting everything needed to make it work (forms, integrations, payment gateways if applicable, analytics, etc.).

I’ll also begin writing your website documentation (which lives *inside* your website for easy access).

Together, we test everything: layout, content, links, forms, and performance. _At this point we won’t be changing anything drastically—just making sure everything works correctly and looks great._

After the site is fully polished, we’ll choose a launch date and go live on that date.

_&rarr;&nbsp; At this point you will make your **third** and final payment._

----

#### 7. Post-Launch Support

For one week after launch, I’m available for questions and support as you settle into the new site.

----

#### 8. Offboarding Call & What’s Next

After the support week, we’ll have an offboarding call to review how everything went.

We’ll talk through the launch, answer any final questions, and discuss next steps if you’d like to continue working together.

----

#### 9. Maintenance

If we agree to ongoing maintenance, your maintenance plan will begin after launch. Your site will be set up to auto-update where possible, and if anything goes wrong or issues creep up, we can address them quickly.

_&rarr;&nbsp; Note: maintenance is a monthly subscription fee._
