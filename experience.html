As a **Senior Developer** at **[Awesome Motive](https://awesomemotive.com)** over a three-year period, I helped modernize the **[AffiliateWP](https://affiliatewp.com)** team by introducing **smarter development practices**, **demanding code quality standards**, and delivering **new, high-impact features** often involving other product teams at the company.

The result was a stronger, more modern AffiliateWP—with **better processes**, **higher code quality**, and a faster, **more consistent rollout of new features** each quarter.
