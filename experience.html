As a **Senior Developer** at **[Awesome Motive](https://awesomemotive.com)** over a three-year period, I helped primarily modernize the **[AffiliateWP](https://affiliatewp.com)** team by introducing **smarter development practices**, **demanding code quality standards**, and delivering **new, high-impact features** often involving other product teams at the company.

The result was a stronger, more modern AffiliateWP—with **better processes**, **higher code quality**, and a faster, **more consistent rollout of new features** each quarter.

During my seven years at **[WebDevStudios](https://webdevstudios.com)**, I worked as a **Senior WordPress Engineer** on large-scale, enterprise-level WordPress projects for clients such as [Microsoft](#microsoft) and [Monster.com](#monster).

My role focused on solving **scalability challenges** for high-traffic WordPress sites—architecting **stable systems**, integrating **complex APIs**, and **ensuring strict brand and performance standards**.

I worked across both **frontend** and **backend** teams, led **optimization efforts**, and **guided key architectural decisions**.

While at WebDev, I helped maintain and develop **enterprise WordPress solutions** for **Microsoft Office 365** and **Microsoft DEV Blogs**.

One of my key responsibilities was managing **"The Mule,"** a background **content-sync system** that syndicated posts across several Microsoft properties. The system parsed and reformatted content into a clean, editable structure while giving editors full control over what was imported or published.

My work focused on improving the **reliability, flexibility, and performance** of this complex system—keeping it compliant with Microsofts strict publishing workflows, scalability requirements, and technical standards.

I also developed **new features**, **resolved difficult issues**, and consulted with Microsoft **leadership** to maintain and improve these platforms.

I helped lead **Core Web Vitals** and performance-engineering efforts for the **Monster.com** employer-facing site: **[hiring.Monster.com](hiring.monster.com)**

I identified and resolved **performance bottlenecks** across both frontend and backend systems, improving **search rankings and overall user experience**. This work included deep analysis in Google Search Console, optimizing caching layers with Redis and Memcached, refining PHP-FPM configurations, and **working directly with WP Engine performance engineers**.

These optimizations delivered **measurable gains** in load times, responsiveness, and **SEO performance**, enhancing long-term search visibility—at a time when *Core Web Vitals was still new*.
