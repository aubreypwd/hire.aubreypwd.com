As a **Senior Developer** at **[Awesome Motive](https://awesomemotive.com)** over a three-year period, I helped modernize the **[AffiliateWP](https://affiliatewp.com)** team by introducing **smarter development practices**, **demanding code quality standards**, and delivering **new, high-impact features**—one of which was the company's *first practical use of AI inside WordPress*.

Each project required balancing long-term maintainability of a **legacy codebase** while adding **new and *modern* features**, ensuring the codebase remained stable while evolving to meet the needs of our customers.

### Notable features I developed:

### Noteable projects:

![Microsoft](assets/images/experience/microsoft.webp)

While at WebDev, I helped maintain and develop **enterprise WordPress solutions** for **Microsoft Office 365** and **Microsoft DEV Blogs**.

One of my key responsibilities was managing **"The Mule,"** a background **content-sync system** that syndicated posts across several Microsoft properties. The system parsed and reformatted content into a clean, editable structure while giving editors full control over what was imported or published.

My work focused on improving the **reliability, flexibility, and performance** of this complex system—keeping it compliant with Microsofts strict publishing workflows, scalability requirements, and technical standards.

- Automated Content Syndication
- System Reliability & Maintenance
- Editorial Workflow Integration
- Architectural Enhancements

I also developed **new features**, **resolved difficult issues**, and consulted with Microsoft **leadership** to maintain and improve these platforms.

![Monster Hiring](assets/images/experience/monster.webp)

I helped lead **Core Web Vitals** and performance-engineering efforts for the **Monster.com** employer-facing site: **[hiring.Monster.com](hiring.monster.com)**

I identified and resolved **performance bottlenecks** across both frontend and backend systems, improving **search rankings and overall user experience**. This work included deep analysis in Google Search Console, optimizing caching layers with Redis and Memcached, refining PHP-FPM configurations, and **working directly with WP Engine performance engineers**.

These optimizations delivered **measurable gains** in load times, responsiveness, and **SEO performance**, enhancing long-term search visibility—at a time when *Core Web Vitals was still new*.

- Caching Strategy
- Search Console Tracking
- Backend Optimizations

When I was a kid they called me a **computer-wiz** as I was always tinkering with computers and later _facinated_ during the early Web. I would eventually become young **self-taught web developer** who would, in 2007, build the first WordPress-based website for my University.
