  I redesigned _this_ website to align with my 2026 focus: **Building _fast_, unhackable, _zero maintenance_ websites.**

  My first site was built quickly in 2025 when I first switched to freelancing. It worked, but it no longer reflected where I was headed and needed updating.

  Since I was updating the content anyway, **I refreshed the design too.** I used an existing HTML template as a foundation and customized it to fit my brand, which let me launch quickly.

  My previous design was **simple**, and I loved that.

  The new one needed to be simple as well, but feel _fresh_ and **updated.**

  It featured a sidebar that sends simple **"blue bubble"** messages to you per-page.

  - "Keep it **simple**"
  - "A new **fresh** coat of paint"

  - "**Calendar** booking integration"

## I needed to save time, like many of my clients.

I wish I could have created a design from scratch, **but I'm spending most of my time building websites for my clients.** I needed a way to get a new site done **quickly** (I gave myself two weeks) and I knew that meant I had to go with a pre-existing design.

### Using a pre-existing template.

**This is something I do often for my clients.** It helps them save money, time, and sometimes they already know what they want, bring in a template, and I work with that. This re-design was a good example of **what I can do for you** when you need **quick,** maybe _cheap,_ but still **good!**

### Performance audit required.

That meant, once I got the template, I needed to make sure it ran _smooth_. That meant taking the template and pacing it through my **performance audit:**

- Examine **JavaScript**, remove anything unnecessary, and make sure nothing was slow
- Examine it through **Core Web Vitals**
- Check HTML semantics to ensure HTML is optimized for SEO
- Reduce unused code and bloat

The template was honestly already _pretty good,_ so it didn't take long to perform the audit.

If a client ever brings in a current design (maybe from a current website), wants to use an HTML template to save time or money, I always perform a _similar_ **performance audit** to ensure that what your site is built with remains _fast_, SEO optimized, accessible, and ready to go online.

## Finally, tweak the template.

The last step was **tweaking the original template,** to fit my specific brand:

![Original template transformation.](/assets/images/study/hire-aubreypwd/original-template.webp)

<div class="text-center">{{ 'The end result was a re-built website **built in 6 days,** that I could get up _quickly_, keep _fast_, that was **ready for launch!**' | markdownify }}</div>
