study_description: |
  I redesigned my website to align with my 2026 focus: **building _fast_, unhackable, _zero maintenance_ websites.**

  My original site was built quickly in 2025 when I first switched to freelancing. It worked, but it no longer reflected where I was headed.

  Since I was updating the messaging anyway, **I refreshed the design too.** I an existing **Ikonicsweb** starter template as a foundation and customized it to fit my brand, which let me launch quickly without starting from scratch.

  My previous design was **simple**, and I loved that.

  The new one needed to be simple aswell, but feel _fresh_ and **updated.**

  It featured a sidebar that sends simple **blue bubble** messages to you per-page.

## I needed to save time

I wish I could have created a design from scratch, but I'm spending most of my time building websites for my clients. I needed a way to get the site done **quickly** (I gave myself two weeks) and I knew that meant I had to go with a pre-exisitng design.

This is something I do often for my clients. It helps them save money, time, and sometimes they already know what they want, bring in a template, and I work with that. This re-design is a good example of what I can do when you need **quick,** _cheap,_ but still **good!**

### Performance Audit

That meant, once I got the template, I needed to make sure it ran _smooth_. That meant taking the template and pacing it through my **performance audit:**

- Examine it through **Core Web Vitals**
- Examine JavaScript, remove anything un-necessary, and make sure nothing was blocking rendering

The template was already pretty good, so it didn't take long to perform the audit. If a client ever brings in a current design (maybe from a current website), wants to use an HTML template to save time or money, I always perform a similar **performance audit** to ensure that the site is _fast_, SEO optimized, accessible, and ready to go online.
