# Straight Talk Web Developer SEO Content Plan

## Overview

Create 5 SEO articles targeting "straight talk web developer" and related trust/transparency keywords. Each article will have:

- HTML file in `/search/` with frontmatter (title, description, keywords, sitemap: true)
- Markdown content file in `/_includes/content/search/`
- Content aligned with messaging from `index.html` (straight talk, no BS, friend-like relationship)
- Style following `agents/CONTENT_STYLE_GUIDE.md` (conversational, direct, contractions, em dashes)

## Brand Voice & Content Framework

### Primary Message (Filter Everything Through This)

You are "the friend with serious web experience" who gives honest guidance, clear explanations, and practical solutions. No fluff, no pressure. You value fundamentals, simplicity, performance, communication, and straight talk, backed by a decade+ doing high-stakes work for agencies and major brands.

### Brand Voice Spec

**Tone:** Calm, direct, friendly, confident. "Like a helpful friend who is also a senior dev."**Default Stance:** Reduce hype, simplify decisions, show tradeoffs plainly.**Language:** No jargon unless explained in one sentence. No vague marketing phrases.**Promise:** "I will tell you when you do not need me" vibe.

### Non-Negotiable Content Rules

- Every article must answer: "What is the simplest thing that will work here?"
- Every article must include a "Straight talk" section that says what NOT to do (and why).
- Never shame DIY/no-code. Often recommend it when it fits.
- Always tie recommendations to outcomes: speed, clarity, maintainability, SEO, conversions.
- Fixed pricing is the default. Hourly only for out-of-scope surprises.

### Repeatable Article Skeleton

Use this structure for all 5 posts:

1. **Opening:** "Hi, I'm [Aubrey](/)..." personal introduction (keep the intro from existing content)
2. **Hook (2-3 sentences):** Name the real problem, reduce anxiety, promise clarity.
3. **Quick answer (bullets):** "If X, do Y. If A, do B."
4. **The decision framework (simple rules):** 3-6 criteria max.
5. **Straight talk (callouts):** Common traps, sales pressure patterns, what is actually worth paying for.
6. **What I would do first (a short checklist)**
7. **CTA:** "If you want a straight answer, send me these 3 details…" (keeps it consistent with the "on your side" positioning)

**Note:** No real examples section (to avoid needing to make up or lie about client work). No internal or external links except the intro link to homepage. Goal is SEO indexing - people will skim and navigate to main index.html naturally.

### Linking Rules

- **No internal links** to other search pages or sections
- **No external links** to other sites
- **Only link:** The intro "Hi, I'm [Aubrey](/)" links to homepage
- Goal: SEO indexing and information. People will skim and naturally navigate to main index.html

### QC Checklist (Run on Every Draft)

**Message Fit:**

- Does it sound like "honest guidance, clear explanations, no fluff" instead of a generic agency blog?
- Is there a clear recommendation AND a clear "when you do not need this"?

**Clarity:**

- Are there any paragraphs that are just vibes (no decision help)? Delete.
- Is the framework short enough someone can use it in 2 minutes?

**Proof:**

- Did it mention your decade+ experience in a natural way once (not braggy), especially on hiring/trust posts?
- Any claims that need evidence are either backed by an example or phrased carefully.

**SEO Basics:**

- One primary keyword + 2-4 secondary variants, used naturally in H1/H2 and intro.
- Title under ~60 chars, meta description ~150-160, matches search intent.
- FAQ section with 3-5 questions that people actually ask.
