<!-- Platform-free -->
{% capture content %}
Most websites today are built on **platforms** like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace**. They can be great tools in the right situation, but for many websites, that approach comes with a lot of **extra bloat** you probably don't need.

For **most websites,** the goal is simple: **a website that stays  _up_, stays _fast_, and _doesn't demand your time._**

{% capture markup %}
I build websites using the **<a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">JAMStack</a>**, a modern tech stack for creating **simple**, **fast**, and **secure** websites.

<!-- Speed -->
{% capture content %}
Platform-freewebsites are **_fast_.**

There is _**no**_ system to boot up, _**no**_ plugins to load, and _**no**_ expensive database queries just to show a web page. The browser receives the page and displays it _instantly._

Platforms like **WordPress** often have to load core systems, themes, plugins, page builders, and databases before anything reaches the visitor. That is why they can require **heavier and more expensive hosting** and still feel sluggish.

Fast websites **keep people around longer**, **reduce bounce rates**, and **increase the chances that visitors take action**.

<!-- Security -->
{% capture content %}
Security problems usually exist because there is **something to log into** or **something running behind the scenes**.

There is **no login page**, **no admin area**, **no database,** and **no background software to exploit**.

When there is nothing to break into, there is **no reason for your website to go down.** Sites with fewer moving parts are far _less likely_ to suffer from outages, compromises, and lost time.

<!-- Maintenance -->
{% capture content %}
Website platforms like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace** put the responsibility **entirely on you**. You are expected to learn the system, keep it updated, avoid breaking things, and fix problems when updates go wrong.

Websites like the ones I build require **zero up-keep by design**. There are **_no_** updates, **_no_** systems to manage, and **_no_** surprises. It just keeps running.

### And I do the updating, not you.

When you want **changes**, **campaigns**, or just do simple **updates**, you don't log into anything and do it yourself.
