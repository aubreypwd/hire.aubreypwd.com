<!-- Platform-free -->
{% capture content %}
Most websites today are built on **platforms** like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace**. These systems try to handle every possible use case, which means they ship with a lot of extra features whether _your website needs them or not._

After working on websites for _over a decade,_ I have seen the same pattern repeat:

{% capture markup %}
**Sites become bloated, complex, and eventually _fragile_.**

What starts out convenient slowly becomes harder to maintain, harder to secure, and harder to keep fast.
{% endcapture %}
{% include page_title.html content=markup %}

Now I build websites without a platform like **WordPress** or **Squarespace** underneath them.

That means no complicated backend systems, no slow databases, and no server-side **bloat-ware** running behind the scenes.

A _platform-free_ website is built as **plain HTML web pages**, the way the web was originally designed to work. By removing the platforms and complexities entirely, you remove what introduce **bloat**, **slowness**, and **maintenance headaches**.

{% capture markup %}
I build sites using **<a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">JAMStack</a>**, a modern way of creating **simple websites**.

Your site is made up of **simple files** that load quickly, behave as intended, and require **no maintenance**.
{% endcapture %}
{% include page_title.html content=markup %}

<!-- Speed -->
{% capture content %}
Websites built without a platform are **naturally _fast_.**

There is no system to boot up, no plugins to load, and no _expesive_ database queries just to show a webpage. The browser receives the page and displays it _instantly._

Platforms like **WordPress** must load core systems, themes, plugins, page builders, and databases before anything reaches the visitor. That is why they require **heavier and more expensive hosting** and still feel sluggish.

Fast websites **keep people around longer**, **reduce bounce rates**, and **increase the chances that visitors take action**.

<!-- Security -->
{% capture content %}
Security problems usually exist because there is **something to log into** or **something running behind the scenes**.

A _platform-free_ website removes those layers entirely.

There is no login page, no admin area, no database, and no background software to exploit. The websites I build are simply **static web pages running on the internet**.

When there is nothing to break into, there is no reason for your website to go down. Platform-free websites are far less likely to suffer outages or compromises.

<!-- Maintenance -->
{% capture content %}
Website platforms like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace** put the responsibility **entirely on you**. You are expected to learn the system, keep it updated, avoid breaking things, and fix problems when updates go wrong.

Websites built without a platform require **zero maintenance by design**. There are no updates, no systems to manage, and **no surprises**. It just keeps running.

### It shouldn't be all on you

When you want **changes**, **campaigns**, or **updates**, you don't have to log into anything and do it yourself. _**I handle all of it**._
