Running your business already takes **enough of your attention.** You do not need another dashboard, another password to remember, another plugin update taking you website down, or another monthly subscription to deal with.

### I want your next website to be out of your way.

Most websites quietly turn into **part-time jobs** for most business owners. You log in to make a small change, something breaks. A plugin needs updating again. The theme breaks, _again!_ Now you are **troubleshooting something you never wanted to manage in the first place.**

{% include page_title.html content="**That is not what running a website should be like.**" %}

Your website should **support your goals,** not _distract_ you from them. It should help people **understand what you do,** _trust you,_ and reach out. That is it! No bloated systems. No learning curve. No babysitting.

### Free yourself from bloated platforms.

Your website is built to be **lean** intentionally, so it **stays out of your way.** There is no _bloat_ hiding underneath it. No unnecessary technology **driving up costs.** No platform lock-in forcing you to keep paying just to keep it alive.

Most normal websites don't need giant frameworks like complex content management systems, or endless feature lists. Those things **increase cost,** **increase maintenance,** and **increase stress.**

{% include page_title.html content="What you _actually need_ is something that **performs,** **gets out of your way,** and is **aligned with your goals.**" %}

### Let me _handle managing your website_ from now on.

The last thing you want to do is login to something and change your website, **let me take care of it.** I'm just a **call,** **email,** or **text** away. I focus on getting **aligned with your goals,** understanding your business, and make the changes **myself.**

### The tools I use are _key._

Most website builders like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace** are built to do everything for everyone. They come packed with a million features, themes, plugins, page builders, that **always lead to stress.**

You usually **only need a few simple goal-oreinted things,** but your website still carries the weight of _everything you didn't ask for._ That extra complexity turns into **slower load times,** _more maintenance,_ and more opportunity for something to break and go wrong!

{% include page_title.html content="The sites built **_avoid that completely._**" %}

They are built using a modern approach often referred to as **<a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">JAMStack</a>**, which keeps things _lean, fast,_ and **secure.**

Because there is no bloated system running things, there are: **No** plugin updates. **No** theme updates. **No** database vulnerabilities. **No** login panels to maintain.

{% include page_title.html content="If there is nothing to log into, **there is nothing to hack.**" %}

### Thier _fast!_

From a performance standpoint, **speed is considered from the beginning,** not patched in later. Pages are lightweight and focused. Visitors get what they want _quickly._ Faster sites **convert better,** **feel more trustworthy,** and create _less friction._

### They **save you money!**

From a cost standpoint, you are **not paying for bloated infrastructure or unnecessary technology.** You are not locked into a platform that forces ongoing subscription fees just to keep your website barely functional.

{% include page_title.html content="This approach keeps things **simple on purpose.**" %}

- It keeps **costs down.**
- It keeps **stress down.**
- It keeps your website **aligned with your goals.**
