<!-- Platform-free -->
{% capture content %}
Most websites today are built on **platforms** like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace**. These systems are designed to handle every possible use case, which means they carry a lot of extra features whether your website needs them or not.

Over the years, working with websites built on these platforms, I have learned that this approach leads to sites that are **bloated**, **complex**, and eventually **fragile**. What starts out convenient slowly turns into something that is harder to maintain, harder to keep secure, and harder to keep fast.

### _Platform-free_ design

I build websites without a traditional platform like **WordPress** or **Squarespace** running underneath them.

That means the website is not powered by a _complicated_ backend system, it doesn't rely on a database, and it doesn't run a bunch of server-side software behind the scenes. And the reason for that is simple: **most websites don't need those things**.

A _platform-free_ website is built as **plain HTML web pages**, the same way the web was originally designed to work. As the industry has introduced more and more features and taken more and more shortcuts, the web itself has become **slower**, **heavier**, and more _complicated_ than it needs to be.

By removing the platform entirely, we remove the system that usually introduces **bloat**, **slowness**, and **maintenance headaches** in the first place.

The technology I use is called **<a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">JAMStack</a>**, which is simply a modern way of building websites as **clean, static web pages**. Instead of relying on a heavy platforms, the site is built into **simple files** that load quickly, behave predictably, and do not require constant attention or maintenance later.

<!-- Speed -->
{% capture content %}
Websites built without a platform are **naturally** _fast_.

They do not need to load a system before sending along your content. There is no platform **booting up**, no **plugins loading**, and no **database being queried** just to display a web page after three seconds of boot up time. The browser simply receives the page and displays it, _instantly!_

Platforms like **WordPress** have to load an entire core system, load a theme, load plugins and extensions, load page builders, and talk to a database before the page can even be sent to the visitor's browser. That is why they require **heavier, more expensive hosting** and still tend to feel sluggish.

A _platform-free_ website runs **natively on the web**, exactly how the web was designed to work. *That's why they're _fast._*

<!-- Security -->
{% capture content %}
Security problems usually arise because there is **something to log into** or **something running behind the scenes** that can be exploited.

A _platform-free_ website **removes those things entirely!**

### There's simply nothing to attack.

There is **no login page**, **no admin area**, **no database full of records**, and **no background software** for someone to attack. The websites I build are simply **static web pages running on the internet**.

There is nothing for an attacker to break into and nothing to steal. That is why these websites are **naturally secure**.

Security does not depend on constant updates, patches, or monitoring. It comes from **simplicity**.

<!-- Maintenance -->
{% capture content %}
Website platforms like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace** put the responsibility **entirely on you** to maintain.

You are expected to **learn the system**, **keep it updated**, **avoid breaking things**, and **fix problems when updates go wrong**. Over time, that becomes **a chore** and a constant source of stress.

Websites built without a platform require **zero maintenance _by design_**. There are **no updates to run**, **no settings to manage**, **no systems to learn**, and **no surprise changes later**.

### Just as importantly, you are not left alone with it.

I handle **everything** related to your website once we launch. Because the site itself does not require constant upkeep, I am not spending time maintaining software, fixing updates, or chasing platform issues down. That saves you **money** and keeps things *simple* and expected.

When you want to change content, run marketing campaigns, or update your site, you do not log into anything and you don't have to do it yourself.

You just tell me what you want to do, and I handle **all of it**.

### Hosting

These kinds of websites can also be **hosted for free**. Because they are simply static web pages, many modern hosting providers offer **free and fast hosting** for websites built like this, and we can take full advantage of that, **saving you money!**

Your website just runs on the internet...quietly and reliably. You can trust it will stay that way while you focus on what you want to do: **running your business.**
