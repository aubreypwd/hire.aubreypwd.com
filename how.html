<!-- Platform-free -->
{% capture content %}
Most websites today are built on **platforms** like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace**. These systems are designed to handle every possible use case, which means they include a lot of extra features whether _your website needs them or not._

Working on platform-based websites for _over a decade,_ I have learned the same pattern always emerges:

{% capture markup %}
**Sites become bloated, complex, and eventually _fragile_.**

What starts out convenient slowly turns into something that is harder to maintain, harder to keep secure, and harder to keep fast.
{% endcapture %}
{% include page_title.html content=markup %}

I build websites without a traditional platform like **WordPress** or **Squarespace** running underneath them.

That means no complicated backend system, no slow database, and no server-side bloatware running behind the scenes. And the reason is simple: **most websites don't need all of that.**

A _platform-free_ website is built as **plain HTML web pages**, the way the web was originally designed to work. By removing the platforms entirely, we remove the systems that usually introduce **bloat**, **slowness**, and **maintenance headaches** in the first place.

{% capture markup %}
I build sites using **<a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">JAMStack</a>**, which is simply a modern way of creating **simple websites**.

Instead of relying on heavy platforms, your website is made up of **simple files** that load quickly, behave as intended, and require **no maintenance**.
{% endcapture %}
{% include page_title.html content=markup %}

<!-- Speed -->
{% capture content %}
Websites built without a platform are **naturally _fast_.**

They don't have to boot up a system, load plugins, or make expensive database queries just to display a web page. The browser receives the page and shows it instantly.

Platforms like **WordPress** must load an entire core system, themes, plugins, page builders, and query databases before anything even reaches the visitor. That is why they require **heavier and more expensive hosting** and still tend to feel sluggish.

### Real business results

Fast websites **keep people around longer**, **reduce bounce rates**, and **increase the chances that visitors actually take action**.

<!-- Security -->
{% capture content %}
Security problems usually exist because there is **something to log into** or **something running behind the scenes** that can be exploited.

A _platform-free_ website removes those layers entirely.

### There's nothing to attack

There is no login page, no admin area, no database, and no background software to exploit. The websites I build are simply **static web pages running on the internet**.

### Fewer risks, less downtime

When there is nothing to break, there is no reason for your website to go down. Platform-free websites are far less likely to suffer outages, compromises, or emergency repairs that take sites offline.

<!-- Maintenance -->
{% capture content %}
Website platforms like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace** put the responsibility **entirely on you**. You are expected to learn the system, keep it updated, avoid breaking things, and fix problems when updates go wrong.

**A stressful and expensive chore.**

When a platform-based website breaks, it often goes offline while someone figures out what is wrong. During that time, you lose **leads**, **sales**, and **trust.**

### You should not be left alone

With the websites I build, I handle **everything** related to your site after launch.

Because the site itself requires very little upkeep, I am not wasting time or charging you to check on software and fix broken updates. That saves you **money**.

When you want **changes**, **campaigns**, or **updates**, you don't have to log into anything or do it yourself.

You just tell me, and _**I handle all of it**._
