  **Performance** isn't something we squeeze in at the end—it's the foundation for everything.

  I treat speed as a **first principle** and how that shapes the work you get.

# Performance First

Websites are inherently simple and built to move quickly. The browsers, protocols, and networks powering the World Wide Web were designed to be efficient, yet so many projects layer on complexity that drags performance down.

I believe that's avoidable—and that intentional performance optimization should lead every project I touch.

Whether you're building a brochure site, a product dashboard, or anything in between, speed matters. I call this approach **Performance-first**: it means we make choices that let the web do what it was built to do, and I keep those choices sacrosanct throughout every engagement.

## Continuous Core Web Vitals validation

**Core Web Vitals** isn't a checkbox for launch day. I monitor metrics every step of the way so the work is always trending toward a fast, smooth experience. That prevents surprises and keeps the finished product in a performant state from the very first build.

## Selective tooling

No! You don't need React, WordPress, or other heavy frameworks for a simple web experience. I strip away unnecessary layers and lean on the leanest toolset possible for each project. The fewer abstractions, the faster—and fewer places for bugs and bloat to hide.

## Top-tier hosting and server tuning

I work with the hosts that actually care about speed and quality. I know the ones that deliver and the ones that slow you down.

When needed, I can tweak server configurations that most freelancers never touch, ensuring the infrastructure can keep up with the experience.

## Practical performance from legacy to greenfield

Sometimes I'm handed a slow legacy build or a recently launched site that never met expectations. I dig into what's dragging it down—bad architecture, bloated assets, poor hosting—and focus on removing those blockers so the experience can breathe again.

## Future-proof thinking

Even when I'm not crafting a new site, I keep performance top of mind. Every recommendation, build decision, and review is filtered through a performance lens because I've seen what can happen when it's ignored.

## Dealing with reality

You may already have a website you love whose only flaw is sluggishness. Maybe the team who built it didn't optimize for the web, or you inherited slow infrastructure. My goal isn't to promise miracles, but to identify the real constraints—hosting, assets, configuration—and move the experience as far as possible toward fast.

Sometimes the answer is a better host. Sometimes it's architectural tweaks. Sometimes it's purging unnecessary dependencies. In every case, the end goal is the same: an experience that feels fast to every visitor, because it is.

**Performance** shouldn't be an afterthought—it's how I approach every request, every rebuild, and every review. If you want a website that feels like the web was meant to feel, let's talk about how we can keep speed at the center of it.
