## What to Look For in a Trustworthy Developer

Here's what matters:

**Communication:**
- Can they explain technical concepts in plain English?
- Do they respond to messages in a reasonable time?
- Do they keep you updated without you having to ask?
- Can you have a normal conversation with them?

**Process:**
- Do they have a clear process for how projects work?
- Can they explain what happens at each stage?
- Do they provide written estimates and scope?
- Do they set clear expectations upfront?

**Transparency:**
- Are they honest about what they can and can't do?
- Do they explain pricing clearly?
- Do they tell you when you don't need them?
- Can they explain why they're recommending something?

**Strategic thinking:**
- Do they ask questions about your goals?
- Do they think about what you actually need vs what you asked for?
- Do they explain trade-offs and options?
- Do they recommend the simplest solution that will work?

## Straight Talk

Here's what you need to know:

**Common traps:**
- **Developers who say yes to everything** — A good developer asks questions and thinks strategically. If someone just says yes to everything without understanding your goals, that's a red flag.
- **Vague estimates** — You should get written estimates with clear scope. If someone can't tell you what's included and what costs extra, that's a problem.
- **Pressure tactics** — If someone pressures you to decide quickly or makes you feel rushed, that's a red flag. Good developers don't need to pressure you.
- **Jargon without explanation** — If someone hides behind technical terms without explaining them, that's a problem. You should understand what you're paying for.

**Red flags:**
- Says yes to everything without asking questions
- Can't explain things in plain English
- Gives vague estimates or won't put things in writing
- Pressures you to decide quickly
- Can't explain why they're recommending something
- Doesn't have a clear process

**Green flags:**
- Asks strategic questions about your goals
- Explains trade-offs and options clearly
- Tells you when you don't need them
- Provides clear written estimates and scope
- Has a clear process they can explain
- Can explain technical concepts in plain English

**What's actually worth paying for:**
- Strategic thinking that saves you money in the long run
- Clear communication that prevents misunderstandings
- Reliable processes that keep projects on track
- Long-term partnership with someone who knows your site

**What's usually NOT worth paying for:**
- Developers who just say yes to everything
- Vague estimates that lead to surprise invoices
- Pressure tactics and rushed decisions
- Jargon without explanation

**When DIY might work:**
- If your needs are simple and you have time to learn
- If you're just starting out and need something basic
- If you're willing to invest your own time to save money

## What I Would Do First

If you're evaluating developers:

1. **Have a conversation** — Can you talk to them normally? Do they explain things clearly?
2. **Ask about their process** — Do they have a clear process? Can they explain it?
3. **Get a written estimate** — Ask for a written estimate with clear scope
4. **Ask strategic questions** — See if they ask about your goals, not just what you want built
5. **Check communication** — Do they respond in a reasonable time? Are they clear in their communication?
6. **Ask "what if I don't need you?"** — See how they respond. A good developer will tell you honestly.

## Essential Deliverables and Milestones

For web projects, you should expect:

**Before work starts:**
- Written estimate with clear scope
- Timeline with milestones
- Clear explanation of what's included and what's extra
- Agreement on communication and updates

**During the project:**
- Regular updates (you shouldn't have to ask)
- Clear communication about progress
- Questions when something is unclear
- Notice if something will affect timeline or cost

**When work is done:**
- Working site or feature
- Documentation if needed
- Clear explanation of what was done
- Instructions for ongoing maintenance if applicable

**For long-term partnership:**
- Someone who knows your site inside and out
- Consistent communication and availability
- Clear process for ongoing work
- Honest advice about what you actually need

---

## How to Evaluate Communication Style

**Good communication looks like:**
- Explains things in plain English
- Responds in a reasonable time (within 24-48 hours for non-urgent things)
- Keeps you updated without you having to ask
- Asks questions when something is unclear
- Tells you about problems early, not at the last minute

**Bad communication looks like:**
- Hides behind jargon
- Takes days or weeks to respond
- You have to chase them for updates
- Doesn't ask questions when something is unclear
- Surprises you with problems or extra costs

---

## Questions to Ask During Initial Conversations

**About their process:**
- "How do your projects typically work?"
- "What happens at each stage?"
- "How do you handle changes or additions?"

**About communication:**
- "How often will I hear from you?"
- "How quickly do you typically respond to messages?"
- "How do you handle problems or delays?"

**About their approach:**
- "How do you figure out what I actually need?"
- "What if I don't need everything I'm asking for?"
- "How do you decide between different solutions?"

**About pricing:**
- "How do you price projects?"
- "What's included in the estimate?"
- "What would be extra?"

## Building Long-Term Partnership vs One-Off Project

**One-off project:**
- Clear scope and deliverables
- Fixed timeline
- Project ends when work is done
- Good for: specific features, one-time fixes, new sites

**Long-term partnership:**
- Ongoing relationship
- Developer knows your site inside and out
- Consistent availability and communication
- Good for: ongoing support, multiple projects, sites that need regular updates

**Which do you need?**
- If you need ongoing support or multiple projects, look for someone interested in long-term partnership
- If you just need one thing done, a one-off project is fine
- Be clear about what you're looking for so you find the right fit

## FAQ

**How do I know if a developer is trustworthy?**
Look for clear communication, strategic thinking, transparent pricing, and a clear process. Ask questions and see how they respond. Trustworthy developers will be honest, even if it means telling you something you don't want to hear.

**What should I expect in terms of communication?**
You should get regular updates, responses within 24-48 hours for non-urgent things, and clear explanations. You shouldn't have to chase someone for updates or explanations.

**How do I evaluate if someone is a good fit?**
Have a conversation. Can you talk to them normally? Do they explain things clearly? Do they ask about your goals? Do they have a clear process? Trust your gut—if something feels off, it probably is.

**What if I'm not technical?**
A good developer will explain things in plain English. If someone can't explain what they're doing in a way you understand, that's a problem. You should understand what you're paying for.

**How long have you been doing this?**
Over a decade. I've worked with agencies and major brands, building high-stakes solutions. Now I work independently, bringing that same experience directly to people and businesses who need a trusted web development partner.

**What makes a good developer different from a bad one?**
Good developers think strategically, communicate clearly, and are honest—even when it means telling you something you don't want to hear. Bad developers just say yes to everything, give vague estimates, and hide behind jargon.
