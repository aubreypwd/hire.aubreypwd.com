  Everyone wants to sell you a redesign. But here's the thing: most websites don't need a full redesign. They need fixes, improvements, or updates.

  If someone is pushing you toward a redesign, take a step back. Here's a checklist of things to try first—because the simplest solution is usually the right one.

## Quick Answer

**If your site has:**
- **Slow performance** → Try performance fixes first
- **Outdated content** → Update content first
- **SEO problems** → Try SEO fixes first
- **Security issues** → Fix security first
- **Broken features** → Fix them first

**If your site has:**
- **All of the above fixed and still not working** → Then consider redesign
- **Fundamental design problems that can't be fixed** → Then consider redesign
- **User experience issues that require new structure** → Then consider redesign

## Straight Talk

Here's what you need to know:

**Common traps:**
- **Agencies pushing unnecessary redesigns** — Sometimes a redesign is recommended because it's more profitable, not because it's necessary. If someone suggests a redesign, ask them what fixes they've tried first.
- **Confusing problems with solutions** — Just because your site has problems doesn't mean you need a redesign. Fix the problems first.
- **"Modern" doesn't always mean "necessary"** — A new design might look nice, but if your problems are performance, content, or SEO-related, a redesign won't solve them.

**What's actually worth paying for:**
- Redesign when fixes have been tried and didn't work
- Redesign when the design itself is fundamentally broken
- Redesign when user experience requires new structure
- Redesign when you've fixed everything else and still need a new look

**What's usually NOT worth paying for:**
- Redesign when performance fixes would solve your problems
- Redesign when content updates would solve your problems
- Redesign when SEO fixes would solve your problems
- Redesign just because someone says your site looks "old"

**When DIY might work:**
- If you have time to learn, you might be able to do some of these fixes yourself
- Content updates are usually something you can do yourself
- Some performance and SEO fixes can be done with plugins or tools
- If your needs are simple, DIY tools might be enough

## What I Would Do First

If you're considering a redesign, here's my checklist:

1. **List every problem** — What's not working? What needs to improve?
2. **Categorize them** — Which are performance? Content? SEO? Design?
3. **Try fixes first** — Fix the problems before redesigning
4. **Measure results** — Did the fixes solve your problems?
5. **Then evaluate** — If fixes worked, you might not need a redesign
6. **Get honest input** — Talk to someone who will tell you if fixes are enough

## When Fixes Are Enough vs When Redesign Is Needed

**Fixes are enough when:**
- Your problems are performance, content, or SEO-related
- The design works, it just needs improvements
- Fixes solve all your problems for less money
- Your current structure supports what you need

**Redesign is needed when:**
- You've tried fixes and they didn't work
- The design itself is fundamentally broken
- User experience requires new structure
- Your current design can't support what you need

**How to tell the difference:**
- If your problems are about how things work (performance, functionality), fix them
- If your problems are about how things look (design, layout), consider redesign
- If fixes solve your problems, you probably don't need a redesign
- If fixes don't solve your problems, then consider redesign

## Cost Comparison: Fixing vs Redesign

**Fixing usually:**
- Costs a fraction of redesigning
- Takes less time to complete
- Causes less disruption
- Can be done incrementally
- Solves specific problems

**Redesigning usually:**
- Costs significantly more
- Takes longer to complete
- Causes complete disruption
- Requires starting from scratch
- Might not solve the underlying problems

**When fixing makes sense:**
- When it solves all your problems for less money
- When it can be done faster than redesigning
- When your current design is functional, just needs improvements

**When redesigning makes sense:**
- When fixes have been tried and didn't work
- When the design itself is fundamentally broken
- When you need structure your current design can't support

## FAQ

**How do I know if fixes are enough?**
Try the fixes first. If they solve your problems, you probably don't need a redesign. If they don't, then consider a redesign.

**What if someone tells me I need a redesign?**
Ask them what fixes they've tried first. If they can't explain what fixes they've tried or why fixes won't work, get a second opinion.

**Can I do some of these fixes myself?**
Yes. Content updates are usually something you can do yourself. Some performance and SEO fixes can be done with plugins or tools. If you have time to learn, you might be able to do more.

**How much do fixes usually cost vs redesign?**
Fixes usually cost a fraction of redesigning. Get estimates for both so you can compare.

**What if I fix everything and still want a new design?**
That's fine. If you've fixed the problems and you just want a new look, that's a valid reason for a redesign. But fix the problems first.

**How long do fixes take vs redesign?**
Fixes usually take less time because you're working with what exists. Redesigning takes longer because you're starting from scratch.
