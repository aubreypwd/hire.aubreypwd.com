  You know that feeling when you're trying to figure out what you actually need for your website, but every developer you talk to seems to push you toward the most expensive option? I'm here to cut through that noise.

  I'm a **straight talk web developer**—which means I'll tell you when you don't need me, when DIY is enough, and when an agency might be a better fit. No upsells, no pressure, just honest guidance and clear explanations.

## Quick Answer

**If you need:**
- **A simple fix or improvement** → I can help with that (fixed price)
- **A new website built** → I can build it (fixed price)
- **Ongoing support and care** → I offer care plans (fixed price)
- **Just advice on what to do** → I'll give you honest guidance, even if it means you don't hire me

**If you need:**
- **A massive enterprise system** → An agency might be better
- **A simple landing page** → DIY tools might be enough
- **Something I can't do well** → I'll tell you and point you in the right direction

## How to Know If You Need a Developer vs DIY vs Agency

Here's a simple framework:

**You need a developer (like me) when:**
- Your site needs custom functionality that templates can't handle
- You want someone who understands both the technical side and your business goals
- You need performance improvements or SEO work that requires technical expertise
- You want a long-term partner who knows your site inside and out
- You need WordPress development, custom plugins, or technical fixes

**DIY/no-code tools are enough when:**
- You're building a simple one-page site
- You're just starting out and need something basic
- Your needs are straightforward and templates can handle them
- You have time to learn and maintain it yourself
- Your budget is very limited and you're willing to invest your own time

**An agency is better when:**
- You need a large team working on multiple projects simultaneously
- You require specialized services I don't offer (like extensive design work or marketing campaigns)
- You need 24/7 support with multiple people on call
- Your project requires resources beyond what a single developer can provide

## What I'll Tell You (Even If It Costs Me)

This is the **straight talk** part—the things other developers might not say because they want your business:

**When you DON'T need a rebuild:**
If your site just needs some fixes, performance improvements, or content updates, I'll tell you. A full rebuild is expensive and time-consuming. If we can fix what's broken for a fraction of the cost, that's what I'll recommend.

**When DIY/no-code is enough:**
If your needs are simple and you have the time to learn, I'll point you toward tools that can help you do it yourself. I'd rather you succeed on your own than pay me for something you don't actually need.

**When an agency is a better fit:**
If your project requires a team, specialized services I don't offer, or resources beyond what I can provide, I'll tell you. I'm not here to take on work I can't do well.

**What's actually worth paying for:**
- Custom functionality that solves a real business problem
- Performance improvements that affect your search rankings and user experience
- Technical expertise that prevents costly mistakes
- Long-term partnership with someone who understands your site

**What's usually NOT worth paying for:**
- Unnecessary features that sound cool but don't help your business
- Over-engineered solutions when something simple would work
- Rebuilds when fixes would solve the problem
- Ongoing maintenance for things you can easily do yourself

## What I Would Do First

If you're evaluating your needs, here's a simple checklist:

1. **List your actual problems** — What's not working? What do you need to accomplish?
2. **Separate wants from needs** — What do you actually need vs what sounds nice?
3. **Consider the simplest solution** — What's the most straightforward way to solve this?
4. **Evaluate your time vs money** — Do you have time to learn, or is it worth paying someone?
5. **Get honest input** — Talk to someone who will tell you the truth, not just sell you something

## What I Offer

**Fix & Improve:**
Performance optimization, bug fixes, security updates, SEO improvements, and technical cleanup. Fixed pricing based on scope.

**Build:**
New websites, WordPress development, custom functionality, and site migrations. Fixed pricing with clear deliverables.

**Care Plan:**
Ongoing support, updates, monitoring, and maintenance. Fixed monthly pricing so you know what to expect.

---

## Pricing Approach

I use **fixed pricing** by default. Here's what affects cost:

**What affects pricing:**
- Scope and complexity of the work
- Timeline requirements
- Technical requirements and integrations
- Amount of custom development needed

**What's included:**
- Clear scope and deliverables upfront
- Written estimates before work begins
- No surprise invoices
- Communication throughout the project

**Hourly only for:**
- Work that's outside the original scope
- Unexpected issues that come up during development
- Additional features you decide to add mid-project

I'll always tell you upfront what's included in the fixed price and what would be extra.

## FAQ

**Do you really tell people when they don't need you?**
Yes. If DIY tools or an agency would be a better fit, I'll tell you. I'd rather you get the right solution than take on work that isn't a good match.

**What if I'm not sure what I need?**
That's fine. We can talk through your situation and I'll help you figure out the simplest thing that will work. No pressure to hire me if it's not the right fit.

**How do you handle pricing?**
Fixed pricing for everything in scope. Hourly only for out-of-scope work or changes you decide to make mid-project. I'll always be clear about what's included and what's extra.

**What if I need something you don't do?**
I'll tell you honestly and point you toward someone who can help. I'm not trying to be everything to everyone.

**How long have you been doing this?**
Over a decade. I've worked with agencies and major brands, building high-stakes solutions. Now I work independently, bringing that same experience directly to people and businesses who need a trusted web development partner.

**What makes you different from other developers?**
I prioritize honest guidance over sales. I'll tell you when you don't need me, when DIY is enough, and when an agency is better. I focus on the simplest solution that will work, not the most impressive one.
