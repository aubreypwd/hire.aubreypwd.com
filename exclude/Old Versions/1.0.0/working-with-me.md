  I'm **excited** about the possibility of working together on your project! 🤩

  This page outlines my **usual** process so you know what to expect—from our first conversation through delivery.

  Depending on the work we do together, the details can shift, but these steps are my starting point for keeping things organized and transparent.

# My Process

My process for most projects are built around a **four**-part process:

* **Discovery**
* **Research**
* **Development**
* **Delivery**

---

# Discovery

## Initial meeting

We start with a short 30-minute call so we can learn who we are, what you are building, and make sure we are a good fit. This call is mostly a chance to chat, set expectations, and decide if we should keep moving forward together.

## Questionnaire, and more in-depth call

After our first call, I send over a fairly detailed questionnaire that takes about 30 minutes to complete. It covers goals, challenges, constraints, and the vision you have for the effort. Clients often gain clarity simply by working through it, and you'll get a copy you can reference later.

Once I've had a chance to absorb your answers, we hop on another call. By this point I already understand the basics, so our time can focus on the nuances that matter most before we lay out the work.

## Proposal

After that meeting I write up an initial proposal in a shared document. It includes:

* My understanding of the opportunity and direction
* The tools, methods, and resources I expect we'll use
* What it will take to reach a successful outcome
* A rough timeline and associated investment

You review the proposal on your own first, then we plan a follow-up call to talk it through. During that call we can dig into anything that needs clarification and make sure the direction feels right before we confirm next steps.

After the call, I revise the proposal based on your feedback and send you the updated version. Once you feel good about everything, I confirm the scope, schedule, and cost so we can start the formal engagement.

## Contract & first payment

Once the proposal is accepted, I prepare a statement of work that spells out deliverables, milestones, and responsibilities. We both digitally sign it so the process stays quick, and I invoice you for the first payment (the retainer) so I can begin the work.

# Research

With the contract signed and the retainer tucked away, I dig into the context: the problem, your audience, the competitive landscape, and any data or assets you've already shared. I look for patterns, pain points, and quick wins before we begin executing so nothing important gets overlooked.

## (If we're building a website)

During this phase I still explore competitors and peers to uncover what's working in your market. I capture visual inspiration with moodboards or stylescapes and sketch out a sitemap so we have a shared understanding of the structure before pages are built. I also summarize the additional materials I need from you (copy, imagery, access, etc.) and keep the shared document up to date. You'll need to send any final assets over before we move on.

# Development

This is the primary phase: I start executing on the agreed work, whether that means designing interfaces, building features, writing content, configuring integrations, or another set of deliverables. The goal is to keep moving forward with regular reviews so we stay aligned on the way the solution is shaping up.

## (If we're building a website)

I typically begin with the homepage, share it over a screen share, and collect one round of focused feedback within 24 hours. After polishing the core page we move through the remaining critical pages, sharing updates, and again asking for one round of consolidated feedback on that batch. Once the main pages are solidified I finish the rest of the site, provide a final revision round, and get everything ready for launch.

## Testing

Before launch, I verify that the deliverables behave as expected—checking functionality, copy, flow, and experience. If it makes sense, we test together so you can be confident everything behaves the way it should, and any bugs or gaps we uncover get addressed quickly. This stage is about polishing and stabilizing the work rather than introducing major revisions.

## Training (if needed)

If your deliverable requires operational know-how—like updating a website or managing a dashboard—I'll walk you through the key parts during a live screen share so you can own the day-to-day after launch.

# Delivery

When everything is ready, I'll confirm how and when to roll out the work so your team or audience can start using it. For websites this means switching your domain over to your new website, for other work it may mean deploying assets or handing over documentation, etc.

## Post-launch support

I remain available for one week after launch to help you settle in, answer questions, and fix any minor issues that pop up.

## Offboarding & maintenance

After that support window, we meet for a quick offboarding chat to recap the project, agree on lessons learned, and discuss whether you'd like ongoing maintenance or services. If we do move forward with ongoing support, we'll set up the cadence and keep everything up to date.
