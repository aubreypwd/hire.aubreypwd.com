  **Performance** isn't something we squeeze in at the end—it's the foundation for everything.

  I treat speed as a **first principle** and how that shapes the work you get.

# Performance First

Websites are inherently simple and built to move quickly. The browsers, protocols, and networks powering the web were designed to be efficient, yet so many projects layer on complexity that drags performance down.

Performance should be assumed from the start—not an extra sprint at the end. When everything is filtered through that expectation, you ship work that feels fast because the web was meant to be fast.

I call this mindset **Performance-first**: treat every decision as a chance to honor the web's proginal design, so the final experience doesn't require retroactive fixes to feel right.

## Continuous Core Web Vitals validation

**Core Web Vitals** isn't a checkbox on launch day. I've been through builds that save it for the end only to cause panic during what should be a smooth and painless launch.

Keeping those metrics healthy throughout the build prevents performance debt from growing and ensures the first version already feels smooth.

## Selective tooling

Don't reach for React, WordPress, or heavy frameworks unless the project truly benefits from them. Leaner tech stacks (like static sites, Vanilla JS, etc) leave less room for bloat, fewer dependencies, and a clearer path to speed.

## Top-tier hosting and server tuning

Fast experiences need **fast infrastructure**. The best hosts take performance as seriously as designers do, which is why partnering with them—and applying the right server tweaks—is worth the investment.

## Practical performance from legacy to greenfield

Legacy systems and rushed launches often hide bloated assets, messy architecture, and indifferent hosting. Giving any project a performance review highlights what can be removed so the experience finally cleans up and delivers the speed it should have had.

## Future-proof thinking

Every decision—whether a new interaction, animation, or CMS layer—should be measured against how it impacts speed. That's how you keep the experience resilient even as new work is layered on.

## Dealing with reality

Some sites look great but feel slow because the people who built them treated performance as a second thought. That's usually hard to fix—but there are ways to get your sites into situations where they can shine.

Better hosts, selective tooling, smarter infrastructure, and removing what isn't needed are all ways to get nearer to the fast baseline the web has always been capable of.

**Performance** shouldn't be an afterthought—it's how every build should be approached. **It's how I approach everything!**

If you want a website that feels like the web was meant to feel, or a solution built with performance in mind, **[let's talk](/#contact)** about keeping speed at the center of it.
