<!-- Fast -->
{% capture content %}
Most website builders like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace** are built to do _everything for everyone_. They offer tons of features, themes, plugins, and page builders, but the trade-off is almost always _speed and bloat._

You may only need a few things, but your website still carries the weight of **everything else.** That extra complexity turns into bloated pages, longer load times, and a site that feels sluggish the longer you have it...**then you start to hate it.**

{% include page_title.html content="Slow websites **convert less**, **frustrate visitors,** and tend to perform **worse** in search results." %}

### Performance-first

I build websites with performance as a **first-principle** approach. Speed is not something I try to fix at the end, it is something **I think about from the very beginning.** As the site is being built, **I am constantly checking how fast it loads.**

### Platform-free

Because I don't use platforms like **WordPress**, **Wix**, **Webflow**, etc, I have **full control** over the _entire system_ from start to finish. **This makes all the difference!**

{% capture markup %}
The technology I use is called **<a href="https://jamstack.org/" target="_blank">JAMStack,</a>** it's the _fastest_ way to build a website!
{% endcapture %}
{% include page_title.html content=markup %}

That means no hidden bloat, no features you are not using, and no surprises later. The web is designed to be fast!

<!-- Unhackable -->
{% capture content %}

If you have ever used **WordPress**, you have probably heard nightmare stories about websites getting hacked. Plugins need updates, themes need updates, and you are always hoping that the next update does not introduce some security issue.

### If there's nothing to log into, there's nothing to hack!

Because there is nothing __extra__ happening on the server, there is literally nothing for someone to hack. You cannot steal data that does not exist, and you cannot break into systems that are not there.

### Platform-free means no worrying.

From a security standpoint, **there is simply nothing to attack.** That is why sites I build are effectively **_unhackable_** and why you do not have to worry about waking up to a broken or compromised website&mdash;**ever!**

{% include cta_contact_simple.html title="Ready to run a website **_without worry?_**"  fa="fas fa-smile-beam" %}

<!-- No maintenence -->
{% capture content %}
### It's all on you!

Website builders like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace** put the responsibility **&nbsp;🫵 on you** to maintain your website.

You are expected to **learn the system**, **keep it updated**, **manage changes**, and work within their limitations. If something breaks, you either **figure it out yourself** or pay someone else to untangle it (_I've untangled many of these kinds of situations in the past_).

Over time, that becomes a **chore** _no one wants to deal with!_

### You focus on what you want to do...

**...not messing around with a website.**

With the way I build websites, there is **nothing for you to maintain.** There are **no updates you need to run,** _no settings you need to manage,_ and **no system you need to learn.**

You don't have to log into anything or **worry about breaking something by accident.** You get to focus on running your business or doing what you love.
