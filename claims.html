<!-- Fast -->
{% capture content %}
I build websites that are fast by default because they are generated ahead of time. There is no database query, no server-side rendering, and no runtime templating when a visitor hits the page. The browser just downloads plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Using tools like Jekyll and Hugo means the heavy work happens at build time, not request time. Pages are pre-rendered, assets are optimized once, and the output is as lean as it can be.

On top of that, I pair static builds with modern hosting and CDNs so content is served from locations close to the user. The result is sites that feel instant, even on slower connections.

	animate_delay="2s"

	content=content %}

{% include cta_contact_simple.html title="Ready to build a _fast_ website?" %}

<!-- Unhackable -->
{% capture content %}
Static sites are hard to hack because there is almost nothing to attack. No login forms, no admin panels, no live database, and no server-side code running on every request.

With JAMstack setups, the surface area for exploits is dramatically smaller. Content changes require a rebuild and deploy, which means attackers cannot inject code or manipulate data in real time.

When dynamic behavior is needed, it is handled through isolated third-party services or APIs with strict permissions. This keeps the core site secure and predictable.

	content=content %}

{% include cta_contact_simple.html title="Ready to run a website without worrying about hacks?" %}

<!-- No maintenence -->
{% capture content %}
Static websites require very little ongoing maintenance because there are fewer moving parts. There are no servers to patch, no databases to tune, and no frameworks constantly breaking at runtime.

Once the site is built, it can run for years with minimal attention. Updates happen by editing content and rebuilding, not by babysitting infrastructure.

This approach reduces long-term cost, risk, and stress. The site stays stable, reliable, and easy to evolve without accumulating technical debt.
