<!-- Fast -->
{% capture content %}
Most website builders like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace** are built to do _everything for everyone_. They offer tons of features, themes, plugins, and page builders, but the trade-off is almost always _speed and bloat._

You may only need a few things, but your website still carries the weight of **everything else.** That extra complexity turns into bloated pages, longer load times, and a site that feels sluggish the longer you have it, **and you start to hate it.**

For examplle, **WordPress** relies heavily on plugins and visual page builders. Each one adds **more** code, **more** requests, and **more** things that have to load before a visitor sees your site. It works, but the more you add, the slower it gets.

{% include page_title.html content="👉&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow websites **convert less**, **frustrate visitors,** and tend to perform **worse** in search results." %}

I build websites with performance as a **first-principle** approach. Speed is not something I try to fix at the end, it is something **I think about from the very beginning.** As the site is being built, **I am constantly checking how fast it loads.**

Because I am not locked into a platform or builder (I don't use a platform), I have **full control** over the entire system from start to finish. **This makes all the difference!**

That means no hidden bloat, no features you are not using, and no surprises later when the site suddenly gets slow. The web is designed to be fast, and with today's connection speeds, there is no reason your website should not feel instant.

<!-- Unhackable -->
{% capture content %}
If you have ever used **WordPress**, you have probably heard nightmare stories about hacked sites. It is common enough that constant updates are just part of what you have to do when you run a site with WordPress.

Plugins need updates, themes need updates, and you are always trusting that the next update does not introduce some security problem. The more plugins a site uses, the more chances there are for something to be exploited. Even **agencies** deal with this issue.

The websites I build work very differently because I don't use system like WordPress to build them. They are made the way the web was **originally intended,** as simple **HTML web pages** delivered to a browser. There is no database running behind the scenes you don't need, no admin dashboard to break into, and no login system for attackers to target.

Because there is nothing __extra__ happening on the server, there is literally nothing for someone to hack. You cannot steal data that does not exist, and you cannot break into systems that are not there.

{% include page_title.html content="👉&nbsp;&nbsp;An HTML web page just loads and displays content. _That is it._ **That's all you usually need.**" %}

From a security standpoint, **there is simply nothing to attack.** That is why sites I build are effectively **_unhackable_** and why you do not have to worry about waking up to a broken or compromised website&mdash;**ever!**

<!-- No maintenence -->
{% capture content %}
Website builders like **WordPress**, **Wix**, and **Squarespace** put the responsibility on you to maintain your website.

You are expected to **learn the system**, **keep it updated**, **manage changes**, and work within the limitations of these systems. If something breaks, you either **figure it out yourself** or pay someone else to untangle it (_I've untangled many of these kinds of situations in the past_).

Over time, that becomes a **chore** _no one wants to deal with!_

With the way I build websites, there is **nothing for you to maintain**. There are no updates you need to run, no settings you need to manage, and no system you need to learn. The site does not slowly decay or require constant attention just to keep working.

When you want to change something, add something new, or run a campaign, **you just tell me.**

{% include page_title.html content="**👉&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll handle it.**" %}

You do not have to log into anything or **worry about breaking something by accident.** You get to focus on running your business or doing what you love, _and I get to do the same_ running your website.

Instead of being handed a complicated tool and told to **🫵&nbsp;manage it yourself,** you get a website that is **simply taken care of.**
