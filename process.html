## **_Discovery_**

We start with a short 30-minute call so we can **learn who we are**, **what you are building**, and make sure we are a good fit. This call is mostly a chance to chat, set expectations, and decide if we should keep moving forward together.

### Chat more...

After our first call, I **send over a fairly detailed questionnaire** that takes about 30 minutes to complete. It covers goals, challenges, constraints, and the vision you have for the website. Clients often gain clarity simply by working through it, and you'll get a copy you can reference later.

{% include page_title.html content="Once I've had a chance to absorb your answers, we hop on **another call** and discuss your project in more detail." %}

By this point I already have a better understanding of where you're at, so our time can focus on the nuances that matter most before we lay out the work.

### Proposal

After that meeting I write up an initial proposal in a shared document. It includes:

* My understanding of the opportunity and direction
* The tools, methods, and resources we will use
* What it will take to reach a successful outcome
* A rough timeline and associated investment

You review the proposal on your own first, then we plan a follow-up call to talk it through. During that call we can dig into anything that needs clarification and make sure the direction feels right before we confirm next steps.

After the call, I revise the proposal based on your feedback and send you the updated version. Once you feel good about everything, I confirm the scope, schedule, and cost so we can start the formal engagement.

### Contract & first payment

Once the proposal is accepted, I prepare a statement of work that spells out deliverables, milestones, and responsibilities. We both digitally sign it so the process stays quick, and I invoice you for the first payment so I can begin the work.

## **_Research_**

{% include page_title.html content="I explore competitors and peers to uncover what is working in your market." %}

With a contract signed and the retainer paid, I dig into the context: **your audience**, **your goals**, **your competitors**, and any data or assets you've already shared. I look for **patterns**, **pain points**, and **opportunities** before we begin designing so nothing important gets overlooked.

### Design Direction

I capture visual inspiration with moodboards and **stylescapes** and sketch out a **sitemap** so we have a shared understanding of the structure before pages are built. I also summarize the additional materials I need from you, like copy, imagery, and access, and keep the shared document up to date.

## **_Development_**

I begin designing and building the website, focusing on structure, layout, and interaction. The goal is to keep moving forward with regular reviews so we stay aligned on how the site is shaping up.

{% include page_title.html content="This is the **primary phase** and longest part of the project." %}

I typically start with the homepage, share it over a screen share, and collect one round of focused feedback within 24 hours. After polishing the core page, we move through the remaining key pages, sharing updates and gathering one round of consolidated feedback per batch. Once the main pages are solidified, I complete the rest of the site, provide a final revision round, and prepare everything for launch.

### Testing

Before launch, I verify that the website behaves as expected, checking functionality, copy, layout, responsiveness, and overall experience. We test together so you can be confident everything works the way it should, and any issues we uncover get addressed quickly.

### Training

I walk you through how to update and manage your website during a live screen share so you feel confident owning it day to day after launch.

{% include pill.html content="Step 4 of 4" %}

## **_Delivery_**

When everything is ready, **I handle the launch** by switching your domain over to your new website and making sure everything is live and functioning properly.

{% include page_title.html content="**I remain available for one week after launch** to help you settle in, answer questions, and fix any minor issues that pop up." %}

### Offboarding & Maintenance

After the support window, we meet for a quick offboarding chat to recap the project, discuss lessons learned, and talk through ongoing maintenance or updates if needed.
