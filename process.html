## **_Discovery_**

### Meet & talk...

We start with a short 30-minute call so we can **learn who we are**, **what you are building**, and make sure we are a good fit. This call is mostly a chance to chat, set expectations, and decide if we should keep moving forward together.

### Learn more, chat more.

After our first call, I **send over a fairly detailed questionnaire** that takes about 30 minutes to complete. It covers goals, challenges, constraints, and the vision you have for the website. Clients often gain clarity simply by working through it, and you'll get a copy you can reference later.

{% include page_title.html content="Once I've had a chance to absorb your answers, we hop on **another call** and **discuss your project in more detail.**" %}

By this point **I already have a better understanding of where you're at,** so our time can focus on the nuances that matter most before we lay out the work.

### Proposal

After that meeting I write up an **initial proposal** in a shared document. It includes:

* My understanding of the opportunity and direction
* The tools, methods, and resources we will use
* What it will take to reach a successful outcome
* A rough timeline and associated investment

You review the proposal on your own first, then we plan a follow-up call to **talk it through.** During that call we can **dig into anything that needs clarification** and make sure the direction feels _right_ before we confirm next steps.

After the call, I **revise the proposal** based on your feedback and send you the updated version. Once you feel good about everything, I confirm the scope, schedule, and cost so we can start a formal engagement.

## **_Research_**

{% include page_title.html content="I explore **competitors** and **peers** to uncover **_what is working in your market._**" %}

With a contract signed and the retainer paid, I dig into the context: **your audience**, **your goals**, **your competitors**, and any data or assets you've already shared. I look for **patterns**, **pain points**, and **opportunities** before we begin building so nothing important gets overlooked.

### Structure before screens.

I outline a **clear sitemap** and direction so we both understand how the website supports your goals _before_ anything is designed or developed. This keeps things focused and avoids wasted effort.

{% include tags_box.html content="💰 At this point you make the **second** of three payments." %}

## **_Development_**

### Build, review, refine.

I begin **designing and building** your website, focusing on **structure**, **clarity**, and **conversion.** The goal is steady progress with **regular feedback loops** so we stay aligned as the site takes shape.

{% include page_title.html content="This is the _primary phase_ and **biggest** part of the project." %}

I typically **start with the homepage** and gather your feedback. Once that foundation feels right, we move through the remaining key pages in batches. After the core pages are solidified, I complete the remaining pieces and provide a final revision before launch.

### Testing

Before launch, **we verify everything works.** Layout, responsiveness, copy, links, performance — all of it. We test together so you feel confident, and anything we uncover gets handled immediately.

{% include tags_box.html content="💰 At this point you make the **third** and final payment before _delivery and launch._" %}

## **_Launch_**

### Go live and stay supported.

When everything is ready, **I handle the launch.** Your domain is switched, your website goes live, and I verify everything is functioning properly. 🎉

{% include page_title.html content="But this is where it gets **even better.** You are not handed a login and wished good luck running your new website!" %}

If something needs to change — new copy, new offer, new page, new idea — you **text, call, or email me.** **We get aligned on the goal of the change.** I handle it. That's it!

- No dashboard to learn
- No settings to manage
- No fear of breaking something

It is like having someone **on your team** whose job is to make sure your website keeps supporting your business.

{% include page_title.html content="You focus on your goals. **I handle your website.**" %}

### Ongoing Support

You always get one free week after launch for final tweaks and settling in. But, after that you can continue working with me on a **monthly retainer** for ongoing updates and improvements.

* Content updates
* New pages
* Design tweaks
* Campaign adjustments
* Troubleshooting
* Improvements, all _aligned with your goals_

As long as the estimated work stays under **three hours per request**, it's usually included. Most requests **comfortably** fall within that window.
