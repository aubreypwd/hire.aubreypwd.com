## **_Discovery_**

### Meet & talk...

We start with a short 30-minute call to **learn who we are**, **what you are building**, and make sure we are a good fit. It is mostly a chance to chat, align expectations, and decide if we should move forward.

### Learn more, chat more.

After that call, I send a **detailed questionnaire** that takes about 30 minutes. It covers goals, challenges, constraints, and your vision. People often gain clarity **just by completing it.** It helps everything else _run smoother._

{% include page_title.html content="After I review your answers, we hop on **another call** and **talk through your project in more detail.**" %}

By this point I already understand where you are at, so we can focus on the nuances that matter before we plan the work.

### Proposal

After that meeting I write an **initial proposal** in a shared document. It includes:

* My understanding of the opportunity and direction
* The tools, methods, and resources we will use
* What it will take to reach a successful outcome
* A rough timeline and associated investment

You review it first, then we schedule a call to **talk it through**, clarify anything needed, and make sure the direction feels _right_.

After the call, I revise the proposal based on your feedback and send the updated version. Once you feel good about it, I confirm the scope, schedule, and cost so we can start a formal engagement.

## **_Research_**

{% include page_title.html content="I explore **competitors** and **peers** to uncover **_what is working in your market._**" %}

With a contract signed and the retainer paid, I dig into context: **your audience**, **your goals**, **your competitors**, and any data or assets you have shared. I look for **patterns**, **pain points**, and **opportunities** so nothing important gets missed.

### Structure before screens.

I outline a clear **sitemap** and direction so we both understand how the website supports your goals _before_ anything is designed or built. This keeps things focused and avoids wasted effort.

{% include pill.html content="Step 3" %}

## **_Development_**

### Build, review, refine.

I begin **designing and building** your website with a focus on **structure**, **clarity**, and **conversion.** We keep momentum with regular check-ins and feedback so the site stays aligned as it takes shape.

{% include page_title.html content="This is the _primary phase_ and **biggest** part of the project." %}

I typically start with the homepage, gather feedback, and refine it. Once the foundation feels right, we move through the remaining key pages in batches. After the core pages are solid, I complete the remaining pieces and provide a final revision before launch.

### Testing

Before launch, we test everything together: layout, responsiveness, copy, links, performance, and overall experience. Anything we find gets handled quickly.

{% include tags_box.html content="💰 At this point you make the **third** and final payment before _delivery and launch._" %}

{% include pill.html content="Step 4" %}

## **_Launch_**

### Go live and stay supported.

When everything is ready, I handle the launch: your domain is switched, your website goes live, and I verify everything is functioning properly. 🎉

{% include page_title.html content="This is where it gets **even better.** You are not handed a login and wished good luck running your new website!" %}

When something needs to change (new copy, new offer, new page, new idea) you **text, call, or email me.** We get aligned on the goal, and I handle it. That is it.

- No dashboard to learn
- No settings to manage
- No fear of breaking something

It is like having someone on your team whose job is to make sure your website keeps supporting your business.

{% include page_title.html content="You focus on your goals. **I handle your website.**" %}

### Ongoing Support

You get one free week after launch for final tweaks and settling in. After that, you can continue with a **monthly retainer** for ongoing updates and improvements.

* Content updates
* New pages
* Design tweaks
* Campaign adjustments
* Troubleshooting
* Improvements, all aligned with your goals

As long as the estimated work stays under **three hours per request**, it is usually included. Most requests comfortably fall within that window.
