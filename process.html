## **_Discovery_**

### Meet &amp; talk...

We start with a short 30-minute call so we can **learn who we are**, **what you are building**, and make sure we are a good fit. This call is mostly a chance to chat, set expectations, and decide if we should keep moving forward together.

### Learn more, chat more.

After our first call, I **send over a fairly detailed questionnaire** that takes about 30 minutes to complete. It covers goals, challenges, constraints, and the vision you have for the website. Clients often gain clarity simply by working through it, and you'll get a copy you can reference later.

{% include page_title.html content="Once I've had a chance to absorb your answers, we hop on **another call** and **discuss your project in more detail.**" %}

By this point I already have a better understanding of where you're at, so our time can focus on the nuances that matter most before we lay out the work.

### Proposal

After that meeting I write up an **initial proposal** in a shared document. It includes:

* My understanding of the opportunity and direction
* The tools, methods, and resources we will use
* What it will take to reach a successful outcome
* A rough timeline and associated investment

You review the proposal on your own first, then we plan a follow-up call to **talk it through.** During that call we can **dig into anything that needs clarification** and make sure the direction feels _right_ before we confirm next steps.

After the call, I **revise the proposal** based on your feedback and send you the updated version. Once you feel good about everything, I confirm the scope, schedule, and cost so we can start a formal engagement.

## **_Research_**

{% include page_title.html content="I explore **competitors** and **peers** to uncover **_what is working in your market._**" %}

With a contract signed and the retainer paid, I dig into the context: **your audience**, **your goals**, **your competitors**, and any data or assets you've already shared. I look for **patterns**, **pain points**, and **opportunities** before we begin designing so nothing important gets overlooked.

### Design Direction: Moodboarding, stylescapes, &amp; sitemaps.

I capture **visual inspiration** with moodboards and **stylescapes** and sketch out a **sitemap** so we have a shared understanding of the structure _before pages are built._

{% include tags_box.html content="💰 At this point you make the **second** of three payments." %}

## **_Development_**

### Develop, design, feedback.

I begin **designing** and **building** your website, focusing on **structure**, **layout**, and **interaction**. The goal is to keep moving forward with **regular revisions** so we stay aligned on how the site is shaping up.

{% include page_title.html content="This is the _primary phase_ and **biggest** part of the project." %}

I typically **start with the homepage** and collect and implement your feedback. After polishing the core page, we **move through the remaining key pages,** sharing updates and gathering feedback per batch. Once the main pages are solidified, I complete the rest of the site, **provide a final revision before launch.**

### Testing

Before launch, **I verify that the website behaves** as expected, checking functionality, copy, layout, responsiveness, and overall experience. We **test together** so you can be confident everything works the way it should, and any issues we uncover **get addressed quickly.**

{% include tags_box.html content="💰 At this point you make the **third** and final payment before _delivery and launch._" %}

## **_Delivery_**

### Launch

When everything is ready, **I handle the launch** by switching your domain over to your new website and making sure everything is live and functioning properly.

{% include page_title.html content="**I remain available for one week after launch** to help you settle in, answer questions, and fix any issues that pop up." %}

### Ongoing Maintenance &amp; Improvements

You get a free week after launch of support for last minute changes, tweaks, or if any issues come up. After the first week, you can continue working with me on a **monthly retainer for ongoing support.**

The retainer covers everything you need to keep your website running smoothly: **content updates, new pages, design tweaks, plugin updates, campaigns, troubleshooting**. All of it.

As long as the estimated work stays under **three hours per request,** it's included. Anything beyond that may need a separate agreement, but most requests fit comfortably within that window.

The monthly fee is based on your project's complexity and the level of ongoing attention it requires.
